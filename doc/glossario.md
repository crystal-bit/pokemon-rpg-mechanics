### Base Stat

- https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Base_stats

Statistiche che rappresentano la forza innata e di base di ogni Pokemon.
Questi valori sono uguali per tutti i Pokemon con lo stesso `pokemon_id`
(esempio: tutti i Pikachu condividono le stesse Base Stat di HP, Forza,
Difesa, ...).

La nomenclatura Base Stat è la più utilizzata anche se:

> From Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen to Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, EVs
> were also officially referred as base stats in English (distinct from what
> fans refer to as [base
> stats](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Base_stats), which are instead
> the stat-affecting values intrinsic to the Pokémon's species).

### Effort Value

- https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Effort_values#Stat_experience

> In Generations I and II, effort points given are equal to the base stats of the
defeated Pokémon species.

> The Pokémon data structure contains two EV bytes for each of the five stats
> (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed and Special), starting at zero when caught and
> with a maximum EV of 65535 for each stat.

> When a Pokémon is defeated, its base stats are converted to effort points and
> then added to the EVs. For example, defeating a Mew grants 100 effort points
> to each EV.
