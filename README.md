## Semplifications

The battle system is a big semplification from the official one. The main objective of this project was exploring GDScript advanced features and not to create a replica of the Pokemon battle system.

Some semplification:

- Only 1st gen Pokemons
- Only 1 save file
- All pokemons use the Medium fast experience curve

## Missing features

- Level up (methods and UI)
- Friendship
- Nature
- AI
- a lot of other details
